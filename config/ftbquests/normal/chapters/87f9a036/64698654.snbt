		"As they explored the cubey landscape, they encountered more of the square-shaped villagers who seemed to have simple but peculiar needs. One wanted to find a rare, sparkling flower, while another needed help gathering resources for a strange-looking potion. Reimu and Marisa enthusiastically tackled each quest they encountered, finding the villagers' missing items and solving their problems."
